Do not answer the questions, simply provide a correct compute graph with specific subquestions and their dependencies. Before calling any function, think step by step to understand the problem. Also consider the following tool types: \n- VISUALIZATION: if the query asks to display any part of the treesequences.\n- CODE_GENERATE: if the query requires using tskit to generate code in Python in order to answer.\n- GENERAL_ANSWER: if the query requires a simple text-based answer.\n- FETCH_FILE: if the query requires fetching a tree-sequence file from the user.\n\nClassify the tool type as one of: VISUALIZATION, CODE_GENERATE, GENERAL_ANSWER, FETCH_FILE."
